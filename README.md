# More Java Assignments
This repository contains more java assignments, completed as part of my undegraduate degree. Each assignment contains an in-depth README file in its folder.
## Appliances Project
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Java by modeling various household appliances. It showcases inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and polymorphism through a hierarchy of appliance classes.
## Patient Queue Management System
This project implements a patient queue management system using Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles and the use of priority queues. It models a healthcare facility's patient intake process, prioritizing patients based on urgency and age.
## Book Management System
This project implements a book management system using Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles, file I/O operations, and the use of priority queues. It allows users to add books to a file, read books from the file, and display them sorted by rating.
